The problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

To find the largest contiguous subarray (Kadance's algorithm)
THE IDEA: 
-> use a varible to hold sum and drop every sum that is lower than your current
* start with the first element
* loop through the rest of the array
* calculate the max between current and the first element
* use max of the sum or the current element
* return the biggest contigous number

Time Complexity:  O(n) from looping through array
Space Complexity: O(1) creating a const varibles
