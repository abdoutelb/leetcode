The problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

To get the exact sum
* HashMap holds unique value with its key
* adding first element with its key of 0
* loop through items
* check if the reminder of the target minus the current loop element exists in hashMap
* if yes return the index of this item and index of current
* if not adding this key with this value to hashMap

Time Complexity:  O(n) from looping through array (searching in map is o(1))
Space Complexity: O(n) for creating a extended HashMap
